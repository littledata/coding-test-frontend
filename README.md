# Test for front-end developers

One challenge we have at Littledata is to categorise our customer websites by industry sector, so we can compare them with websites from the same industry.

The app we want you to build, using your chosen Javascript framework (angular / react / meteor) has one user story:

- **As a public user I can submit any URL and get feedback after it is submitted**

You **do not** need to write the back end for the app; but you can fake a response so the user gets feedback.

We are looking for well structured and commented code, and in the 2nd interview we will ask why you made certain design choices.

For bonus points you should consider
- how to make the form inviting
- how to check the input is a URL
- how to handle a delay in the user getting a response from the server

Good luck! We expect this to take an hour or two to complete.
